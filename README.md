This repository contains the verification IP of a Timer

# Features of a Timer IP

1. 64-bit timer with 12-bit prescaler and 8-bit step register
2. Compliant with RISC-V privileged specification v1.11
3. Configurable number of timers per hart and number of harts

###### Description
The timer module provides a configurable number of 64-bit counters where each counter increments by a step value whenever the prescaler times out. Each timer generates an interrupt if the counter reaches (or is above) a programmed value. The timer is intended to be used by the processors to check the current time relative to the reset or the system power-on.

###### Compatibility
The timer IP provides memory-mapped registers mtime and mtimecmp which can be used as the machine-mode timer registers defined in the RISC-V privileged spec. Additional features such as prescaler, step, and a configurable number of timers and harts have been added.


# Features of a Timer verification IP

The verification IP is build on Universal verification methodology (UVM) that contain `Constrained Random Testbenches`.

## Working of verification IP

Note: Configuration of the timer is completely randomize by UVM testing environment for all internal registers of timer.

#### Configuration the timer

1. Reset the Timer.
2. First, verification IP generates randomized 64 bit `data` that configure the `COMPARE_REGISTERS` of timer to set the value that timer counts.
3. If `data` to be counted is less than or equal to `64'h00000000FFFFFFFF` then set 32 bit register `COMPARE_UPPER_REGISTER` to zero located at address `0x110`, and also set 32 bit register `COMPARE_LOWER_REGISTER` located at address `0x10c` to value to be counted i.e `data`.
4. If `data` to be counted is greater than `64'h00000000FFFFFFFF` then set 32 bit registers `COMPARE_UPPER_REGISTER` & `COMPARE_LOWER_REGISTER` to upper 32 bits of `data` and lower 32 bits of `data` located at `0x110` & `0x10c` respectively.
5. Randomize prescale bits and step bits in the register `CFG0` located at address `0x100`.
6. Enable interrupt by setting zeroth bit of register `INTR_ENABLE0` located at address `0x114`.
7. Verification IP calculates and predicts the number of clock cycles required to complete the counting. The prediction of clock cycle is calculated depening on prescale and step assigned in register `0x100` as mentioned in point 4.

#### Activation the timer

8. Acticate the timer by setting zeroth bit of register `ALERT_TEST` located at address `0x0`.

#### Result

9. Waits until `intr_timer_expired_0_0_o` signal is enabled from the DUT (timer), that indicates timer has compeletd the counting.
10. Compare the number of clock cycles after which `intr_timer_expired_0_0_o` signal is enabled with the predicted clock cycle calculated before (mentioned in point 7).
11. If comparison is succussful then contrained random UVM test is `PASSED`.

# How to run the verification IP?

Clone respositaries [common_peripheral_ip](https://github.com/merledu/common_peripheral_ips) and [common_peripheral_vips](https://github.com/merledu/common_peripheral_vips) that contain IP and verification IP respectively. Clone the mentioned repositories parallel to each other using following couple of `commands`

```
git clone https://github.com/merledu/common_peripheral_ips.git
```
```
git clone https://github.com/AuringzaibSabir/timer_verification_ip.git
```

## For running verification IP with different number of contraint random test
Redirect to the following `path` to test the `timer`
```
cd timer_verification_ip/timer/
```

Excecute the `command` python run_test.py < enter number of test to run >

```
python run_test.py 100
```

In above command `100` means 100 constraint random test will be generated.

Note you can observe the test results in `test_result.txt` file

## OR

### Can also run the single test by following steps

Redirect to the following `path` to test the `timer`
```
cd timer_verification_ip/timer/
```
Excecute the `command`
```
./command
```
